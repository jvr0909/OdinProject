        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced        </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced        </li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup cashews, roughly chopped        </li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped        </li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise and scoop out the flesh, leaving the shells intact. Dice the pineapple flesh into small chunks and set aside.        </li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until they become translucent and fragrant.        </li>
        <li>Add the diced bell pepper, carrot, and frozen peas to the skillet. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the vegetables become tender-crisp.        </li>
        <li>Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet and add the cooked jasmine rice to the other side. Break up any clumps and stir-fry the rice for a couple of minutes, allowing it to heat through.        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce and curry powder until well combined. Pour the mixture over the rice and vegetables, stirring well to evenly distribute the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add the diced pineapple, cashews, and chopped green onions to the skillet. Stir-fry for another minute or two, ensuring all the ingredients are well combined and heated through.        </li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remember that the soy sauce already contains salt, so adjust accordingly.        </li>
        <li>Carefully spoon the pineapple fried rice mixture back into the pineapple shells. Garnish with additional chopped green onions or cashews if desired.        </li>
        <li>Serve the pineapple fried rice while it's still hot and enjoy!        </li>

    </ol>
