    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This pancake recipe offers a delightful and versatile way to start your day with a stack of fluffy and delicious pancakes. The combination of simple ingredients creates a perfect balance of flavor and texture. Begin by mixing the dry ingredients—flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt—in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter until they form a smooth mixture. Combining the wet and dry ingredients forms a luscious batter that rests for a few minutes, allowing the leavening agents to work their magic. As you cook the pancakes on a preheated skillet or griddle, the tantalizing aroma of freshly cooked pancakes fills the air. Watch as bubbles form on the surface, signaling the perfect time to flip each pancake to achieve a golden brown hue on both sides. The result is a fluffy and light pancake with a slight tang from the buttermilk, complemented by a touch of sweetness from the sugar. The versatility of this recipe invites customization—whether you choose to add vanilla extract, cinnamon, or an array of toppings like blueberries, chocolate chips, or sliced bananas, the possibilities are endless. The joy of indulging in these homemade pancakes, drizzled with maple syrup and adorned with your favorite toppings, creates a breakfast experience that is truly delightful.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>

    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients: 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Whisk them together until evenly mixed.        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup of buttermilk, 1 large egg, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter until well combined.        </li>
        <li>Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the buttermilk mixture into it. Gently stir the batter using a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay. Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes.        </li>
        <li>While the batter rests, preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. If needed, lightly grease the surface with cooking spray or a small amount of butter.        </li>
        <li>Ladle approximately ¼ cup of batter onto the hot skillet for each pancake. You can adjust the size based on your preference.        </li>
        <li>Cook the pancakes until bubbles form on the surface, usually taking around 2-3 minutes. Once you see the bubbles, flip the pancakes using a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until golden brown on the other side.        </li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a warm plate or a baking sheet in a preheated oven set to low temperature to keep them warm while you cook the remaining batter.        </li>
        <li>Repeat steps 5-7 until all the batter is used, adding more butter or cooking spray to the skillet if necessary.        </li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, chocolate chips, or whipped cream.        </li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade pancakes while they are warm and fluffy.        </li>
    </ol>
